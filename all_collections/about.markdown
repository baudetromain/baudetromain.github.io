My name is Romain Baudet, 22 years old, graduated in IT from the [Polytech Nice Sophia][pns-website] school, in cybersecurity specialization.  
__I have a job, but I'm open to other job offers.__

## Work experiences

__june 2022 - august 2022__: internship in [INRiM][inrim-website], Torino, Italy  
Description of the job: INRiM is an Italian national physics research institute. There are 5 IT people managing the whole IT infrastructure of the institute. I helped one of them, and developped internal tools for the institute.

__march 2023 - september 2023__: internship in [NXP semiconductors][nxp-website], Mougins, France.
Description of the job: NXP produces multiple different SoC (System on a Chip), but they all have the ARM architecture in common. ARM CPUs have a security isolation feature called ARM-trustzone, that makes both a non-secure and a secure execution context, both isolated from each other. To use this hardware architecture, a software called TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is necessary. I am working on making NXP's SoC a new standard called PSA (Platform Security Architecture).

__september 2023 - present__: working for [Alten][alten-website]
Description of the job: I'm responsible of the management of vulnerabilities in Ekinops. My job consists of looking at the newly published CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures) and find out which ones are impacting Ekinops' products, and to take care of each CVE through their entire lifecycle.

## Languages

__French__: native language  
__English__: good mastery, 905/990 at the TOEIC exam  
__Italian__: I used to speak it quite well, but the lack of practice made me forgot a lot of vocabulary

## Technical skills

__Rust__: basic knowledge (I'd like to learn it for real but I can't find the time/motivation)

# Other

Cybersecurity topics studied in class: networking, cryptography, pentesting, web applications common vulnerabilities, android applications reverse engineering, OSINT.  
On my free time, I'm taking courses on [Hack the box Academy][htb-academy-website], following the *pentester* [job role path][htb-academy-paths].  
I'm also playing CTFs from time to time. I tried to write writups of a few challenges of a CTF I enjoyed, which can be found on [the main page][main-page] of this site.

# CTFs

as mentionned before, I sometimes play CTF (Capture The Flag, a kind of "hacking" competition where the goal is to solve as many "hacking" challenges as possible). I made writeups of a few Nahamcon CTF challenges (mobile category), which I really enjoyed. You can find the first one [here][first-post].
